In the manuscript folder, set up a latex source file and a bibtex source file, so that they compile to a pdf paper. This paper should have the following components.

+ one in-line math expression and one equation in displaystyle.

+ one table.

+ one figure.

+ some relevant references: one with \citep and the other with \citet. 

+ cross referencing sections, figures, and tables.
